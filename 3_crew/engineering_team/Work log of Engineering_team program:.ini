# Agent: Engineering Lead for the engineering team, directing the work of the engineer
## Task: Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design for the engineer; everything should be in 1 python module, but outline the classes and methods in the module. Here are the requirements: 
A simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.
The system should allow users to create an account, deposit funds, and withdraw funds.
The system should allow users to record that they have bought or sold shares, providing a quantity.
The system should calculate the total value of the user's portfolio, and the profit or loss from the initial deposit.
The system should be able to report the holdings of the user at any point in time.
The system should be able to report the profit or loss of the user at any point in time.
The system should be able to list the transactions that the user has made over time.
The system should prevent the user from withdrawing funds that would leave them with a negative balance, or
 from buying more shares than they can afford, or selling shares that they don't have.
 The system has access to a function get_share_price(symbol) which returns the current price of a share, and includes a test implementation that returns fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.
 IMPORTANT: Only output the design in markdown format, laying out in detail the classes and functions in the module, describing the functionality.

# Agent: Engineering Lead for the engineering team, directing the work of the engineer
## Final Answer: 
```markdown
# Design for the `accounts.py` Python Module

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. The main class of the module is `Account`, which manages user accounts, their holdings, and transactions.

## Class: `Account`

### Properties

- `self.username`: `str`  
  The username of the account holder.

- `self.balance`: `float`  
  The current balance of the user's account in currency.

- `self.holdings`: `dict`  
  A dictionary mapping stock symbols (`str`) to quantities (`int`) representing the user's current holdings.

- `self.transactions`: `list`  
  A list of transactions (each transaction is a dictionary with transaction details).

- `self.initial_deposit`: `float`  
  The total initial deposit made to the account, used for profit/loss calculations.

### Methods

- `__init__(self, username: str) -> None`  
  Initializes a new account with the given username, a zero balance, empty holdings, and transactions list.

- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`  
  Adds funds to the account balance. Raises an error if the amount is non-positive.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`  
  Withdraws funds from the account balance. Raises an error if the amount is non-positive, or if the withdrawal would result in a negative balance.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`  
  Buys a specified quantity of shares for the given symbol. Raises an error if funds are insufficient or if the quantity is non-positive.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`  
  Sells a specified quantity of shares for the given symbol. Raises an error if the quantity exceeds current holdings or if the quantity is non-positive.

- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`  
  Calculates and returns the current total value of the user's portfolio by summing the value of all held shares at current prices.

- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`  
  Calculates and returns the profit or loss with respect to the initial deposit.

- `report_holdings(self) -> dict`  
  Returns the current holdings of the user as a dictionary of symbols to quantities.

- `report_transactions(self) -> list`  
  Returns the list of all transactions that have been made by the user.

- `get_fund_status(self) -> dict`  
  Returns a dictionary with current balance, portfolio value, and overall profit/loss.

### Function: `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`

A support function that returns the current price of a share. For testing purposes, it returns fixed prices for specific symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL).

## Error Handling

The methods in the `Account` class raise appropriate errors for invalid operations, such as attempting to withdraw more money than is available, purchasing shares without adequate funds, or selling shares not owned.

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize account
user_account = Account(username="johndoe")

# Deposit funds
user_account.deposit(1000.00)

# Buy shares
user_account.buy_shares(symbol="AAPL", quantity=5)

# Sell shares
user_account.sell_shares(symbol="AAPL", quantity=2)

# Withdraw funds
user_account.withdraw(100.00)

# Check portfolio value
portfolio_value = user_account.calculate_portfolio_value()

# Check profit or loss
profit_loss = user_account.calculate_profit_loss()

# Report holdings
holdings = user_account.report_holdings()

# List transactions
transactions = user_account.report_transactions()
```

This design outlines the functionality of the `Account` class, providing the necessary methods to manage deposits, withdrawals, transactions, and portfolio valuation for a trading simulation environment.

# Agent: A Gradio expert to who can write a simple frontend to demonstrate a backend
## Task: Write a gradio UI in a module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class in accounts.py. Assume there is only 1 user, and keep the UI very simple indeed - just a prototype or demo. Here are the requirements: 
A simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.
The system should allow users to create an account, deposit funds, and withdraw funds.
The system should allow users to record that they have bought or sold shares, providing a quantity.
The system should calculate the total value of the user's portfolio, and the profit or loss from the initial deposit.
The system should be able to report the holdings of the user at any point in time.
The system should be able to report the profit or loss of the user at any point in time.
The system should be able to list the transactions that the user has made over time.
The system should prevent the user from withdrawing funds that would leave them with a negative balance, or
 from buying more shares than they can afford, or selling shares that they don't have.
 The system has access to a function get_share_price(symbol) which returns the current price of a share, and includes a test implementation that returns fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.
