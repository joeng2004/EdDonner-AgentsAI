### Thought Process

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the concept of an infinite series and mathematical formulas. The given series is an alternating series of 1/n, where n takes odd values starting from 3 (since 1/2 would make the series not start from 1).

We'll use the following steps to calculate the sum of this series:

- Calculate the first term as 1.
- Initialize a variable `sum` with value 1 and another variable for the denominator (`denominator`) with value 3.
- In a loop, starting from n = 3, we'll calculate each term as (-1)^n / denominator and add it to `sum`. We increment `denominator` by 2 in each iteration (since we are considering odd denominators).
- We continue this process until the total number of terms reaches 10,000.
- After calculating all terms, multiply `sum` by 4.

### Final Answer

```python
import math

# Function to calculate series sum
def calculate_series(n):
    # Initialize variables
    denominator = 3
    sign = -1
    
    # Calculate the first term as 1
    total_sum = 1
    
    # Loop until the number of terms reaches 'n'
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):  
        if (denominator % 2) != 0:
            total_sum += sign / denominator 
        else:
            pass
        
        denominator += 2
        sign *= -1
    
    return total_sum

# Multiply the sum by 4
sum_series = calculate_series(10000)
result = sum_series * 4

print(result)

# Write result to a text file for output
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(result))

```

The code defines a function `calculate_series` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms in the series. It uses a loop to calculate each term and add it to `total_sum`. The sign is toggled with every iteration for even denominators.

After calculating all 10,000 terms, it multiplies the sum by 4 and prints the result.

To make sure that the output of the code matches the expected result for verification purposes, I have added code to write the result into a file named "output.txt". Please make sure you use this file when running your code and do not modify or delete any other files from the directory
