Looking at this Deep Research notebook, I'll walk you through what this code demonstrates - it's a fantastic example of building a multi-agent research system.

## Overview: Building a Research Pipeline

This notebook creates an automated research system that can take a query, plan searches, execute them, write a comprehensive report, and email the results. It showcases several key agentic AI concepts working together.

## The Agent Architecture

The system uses four specialized agents, each with a specific role:

**1. Planner Agent**
```python
planner_agent = Agent(
    name="PlannerAgent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    output_type=WebSearchPlan,
)
```
This agent takes a research query and breaks it down into multiple strategic web searches. It uses structured outputs (Pydantic models) to ensure consistent formatting - returning a `WebSearchPlan` with reasoning for each search.

**2. Search Agent** 
```python
search_agent = Agent(
    name="Search agent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[WebSearchTool(search_context_size="low")],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    model_settings=ModelSettings(tool_choice="required"),
)
```
This agent executes individual web searches and produces concise 2-3 paragraph summaries. The `tool_choice="required"` ensures it always uses the web search tool.

**3. Writer Agent**
```python
writer_agent = Agent(
    name="WriterAgent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    output_type=ReportData,
)
```
Takes all the search results and synthesizes them into a comprehensive 1000+ word markdown report with structured output including summary and follow-up questions.

**4. Email Agent**
```python
email_agent = Agent(
    name="Email agent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[send_email],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
```
Converts the report into well-formatted HTML and sends it via email using a custom SendGrid integration.

## The Execution Flow

The magic happens in the orchestrated workflow:

```python
async def main_research_flow():
    search_plan = await plan_searches(query)        # Plan what to search
    search_results = await perform_searches(search_plan)  # Execute searches in parallel
    report = await write_report(query, search_results)    # Synthesize findings
    await send_email(report)                              # Distribute results
```

## Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated

**Structured Outputs**: The code uses Pydantic models like `WebSearchPlan` and `ReportData` to ensure agents return data in predictable formats - crucial for agent-to-agent communication.

**Async Execution**: Notice the `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` in `perform_searches()` - this runs multiple searches concurrently rather than sequentially, dramatically improving performance.

**Tool Integration**: Shows both hosted tools (WebSearchTool) and custom function tools (send_email with SendGrid).

**Prompt Engineering**: Each agent has carefully crafted instructions tailored to its specific role, demonstrating how to create focused, specialized agents.

## Commercial Value

This pattern is incredibly powerful because it automates what traditionally requires hours of manual research work. You could adapt this for:
- Market research reports
- Competitive analysis 
- Technical due diligence
- Academic research assistance
- News monitoring and briefings

The modular design means you can easily swap components - use different search engines, add fact-checking agents, or integrate with different communication channels.

This is a sophisticated example that shows how multiple agents can work together in a pipeline, each contributing their specialized capabilities to produce something far more valuable than any single agent could create alone.
