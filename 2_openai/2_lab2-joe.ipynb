    "Google has released their Agent Development Kit (ADK). It's not yet got the traction of the other frameworks on this course, but it's getting some attention. It's interesting to note that it looks quite similar to OpenAI Agents SDK. To give you a preview, here's a peak at sample code from ADK:\n",

    "```\n",

    "    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n",
    "    description=\"Agent to answer questions about the time and weather in a city.\",\n",
    "    instruction=\"You are a helpful agent who can answer user questions about the time and weather in a city.\",\n",
    "    tools=[get_weather, get_current_time]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "And a student has contributed a customer care agent in community_contributions that uses ADK."
